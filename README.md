# Ecommerce-Microservice
An ecommerce microservice simple project to demonstrate my knowledge of microservices architectures. There is an inventory service that contains a list of all product in store, a product service that allows for creation of new products and an order service that allows users to place order on one or more products.
The project features the use of Discovery server to store the details of the address of each services in its registry for easy accessibility. An API-Gateway was used as an entry point to every services that exists.I provided security for the api-gateway with the use of key cloak. Other features like circuit breaker, distributed tracing and Kafka was used in achieving the full scope of the project.
